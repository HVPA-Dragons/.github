# HVPA Dragons GitHub

## About the Team
Hudson Valley Pathways Academy or HVPA is a 6 year, P-TECH model school located in Stone Ridge, New York. Our team is a 
little different from other teams because our team is our entire school. We are able to do this because of how small it 
is. Also, instead of working on our robot after school, we have a designated time in the school day. At HVPA we have 2 
“pathways” to choose from, Advanced Manufacturing, or Cisco & Cyber-security. FIRST fits in well because it includes 
aspects of both of these pathways.

## Resources for Teams
